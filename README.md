I wanted to create a simple game using html, so I decided to make Rock Paper and Scissors game as my project 1. Also,my second project is a stopwatch and clock working together in a pink theme.

Project 1 : Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple interactive game where players choose rock, paper, or scissors
to compete against the computer. The winner is determined based on the classic rules: rock crushes
scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

Project 2 : Stop Watch / Clock
A stopwatch/clock application combines the functions of a stopwatch and a clock. It allows users to
measure elapsed time with start, stop, and reset features, while also displaying the current time. The
interface typically shows hours, minutes, and seconds, providing a versatile tool for timing activities and
checking the time simultaneously
