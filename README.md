In the realm of web development, I have undertaken two distinct projects that showcase my skills and creativity.

Project 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a straightforward interactive application wherein players select rock, paper, or scissors to compete against the computer. The outcome is determined according to the traditional rules: rock defeats scissors, scissors defeat paper, and paper defeats rock.

Project 2: Stopwatch and Clock Application
This application combines the functionalities of a stopwatch and a clock. It enables users to measure elapsed time through start, stop, and reset controls while concurrently displaying the current time. The interface shows hours, minutes, and seconds, providing a practical and versatile tool for timing activities and monitoring the time. The design will incorporate a consistent pink-themed aesthetic.
